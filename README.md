# 🌙 Moonlight
What is Moonlight, you're wondering? 

Moonlight is a feature packed Discord bot framework built on top of the Discord.js wrapper.

## 📝 Requirements
- Node.js (to find out the specific minimum version you'll need, check out the [ECMAScript target](https://github.com/penfoldium/moonlight/blob/master/tsconfig.json#L3) and what Node version is [compatible](https://node.green) with it - E.G. [Node.js v12.0.0 has 100% support for ES2019](https://i.imgur.com/eMsT1SV.png))

## ⚙ Features
Moonlight comes with a lot of features OOTB, including (but not limited to):
- Command and event handler
- Argument parser (you can find the built-in arguments [here](https://github.com/penfoldium/moonlight/tree/master/src/lib/arguments))
- Monitors
- TypeScript support (Moonlight in itself is also written in TypeScript to ensure fast and bug-free code)

FYI you can see future features [here](https://github.com/penfoldium/moonlight/projects/1)!

## 💿 Installation
Moonlight will eventually be published on NPM under `@penfoldium/moonlight`, but for now feel free to use the #build branch (`npm install penfoldium/moonlight#build`) (**rolling release, can break any time**)
